A bit of everything really! (Except sound and lighting- I think I was always a bit too much of a technophobe for that!). Acting, stage managing, producing, costume and props, make up, front of house...etc
The theatre made my University experience more special than I ever could have imagined. I was interested in it after an Open Day tour, but I never could have predicted that I would step inside in one of my first weeks and (happily) almost never leave. I have met friends for life and had some amazing experiences thanks to the theatre and despite some very late nights, resulting tight coursework deadlines/missed lectures and abandoning my housemates for weeks on end, I wouldn't have changed a single second of it.
